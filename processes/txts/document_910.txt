Title: natural frequencies of continuous beams of uniform
span length .
Author: ayre,r.s. and jacobson,l.s.
Body:
natural frequencies of continuous beams of uniform
span length .
  a simple graphical network is used to determine the
natural frequencies of flexural vibration of continuous
beams having any number of spans of uniform length .
the network is based upon a relatively few calculated
values .
