Author: thom, a.
Body:
the flow past circular cylinders at low speeds .
this paper deals chiefly with calculations and experiments on the flow
past circular cylinders, but the arithmetical methods of solution of the
 equations of steady viscous flow proposed and used in section i, are
applicable to other equations and may be of interest .
