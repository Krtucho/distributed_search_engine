Title: thermal buckling of supersonic wing panels .
Author: hoff,n.j.
Body:
thermal buckling of supersonic wing panels .
  the temperature and thermal stress distributions are analyzed
in multicellular supersonic wing structures .  a buckling criterion
is established for the panels of cover plates subjected to thermal
stresses .
