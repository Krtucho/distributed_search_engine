Title: buckled states of circular plates .
Author: keller,h.b., keller,j.b. and reiss,e.l.
Body:
buckled states of circular plates .
  authors discuss the thin elastic circular disk of constant
thickness subjected to a constant compressive thrust applied at its
edge .  the analysis presented is based upon the nonlinear von
karman equations of plate theory and is applied to disks with
completely clamped and completely, simply supported edges .
