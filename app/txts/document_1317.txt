Title: shock-tube testing time .
Author: anderson, g.
Body:
shock-tube testing time .
in a theoretical investigation of attenuation effects of the shock wave
the conservation of mass equation led to an explanation of the
difference between the ideal theoretical test time and the experimentally
obtained time . a numerical example is given .
